Program 84 : Reverse the Last n Bits

                 From time to time,
             in the course of human events,
             it becomes necessary to take an integer value and reverse its last n
                 bits.In this program,
             you are to complete the program below.A working version of this program can be found in ~canning / public / 101 / p84.You can run my copy so you can see whatï¿½s what.This is likely to be a challenging problem.I do not want to discourage the average student so do not fret too much if you do not get it.I would like to see the students who are getting all the problems in a timely manner
try
  this one.Our ability to reverse the last n
      bits of a number positively affects your life each and every day.The answer produced will have the uppermost bits
          zeroed out and the last n bits will be the reverse of the last n bits of the argument x.
