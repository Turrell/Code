Program 92 : Frequency Distribution of Array Elements

                 Write a C program that reads in 20 integers into an array.Each of the integers is between -
        10 and
    10 inclusive.It
        then writes to the screen on separate lines each distinct integer along with the number of times that it occurs.If a
            particular integer does not occur then do not write its frequency.The lines of integers should appear in descending
                order.For example,
    if you had only the following seven integers :

    -7 3 3 -
    7 5 5 3

    as data in the array,
    your program would output :

        5 occurs 2 times 3 occurs 3 times - 7 occurs 2 times

                                                Your program must first fill your array of with 20 integers.Next,
    you should process the array and output the
            results in the format shown above.Do not modify or
        rearrange the elements in the integer array once they are
                stored.An executable image showing you the right answer is given in
