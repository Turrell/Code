Program 98: Print Thyself

I want you to create a C program that can print itself without opening a file.

If need be, you are permitted to copy a solution from the web. If you do so, please identify the link where you got
your solution.

In either case, staple to your hardcopy solution a written explanation of the code. Your statement should be
sufficiently clear to convince me that you understand how the code works. Your written work should be
presentable. If your penmanship is poor, then please type your explanation.

There is no need to provide an electronic submission for this program. A hard copy with explanation will do.
