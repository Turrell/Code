Program 93: Igpay Atinlay
Taken from the 1989 University of Lowell High School Invitational Programming Contest.

For this problem, you are to translate a paragraph of ordinary English text into Pig Latin. Unlike real Latin, the
translation rules for Pig Latin are simple:

Rule 1) If a word starts with a consonant, then translate the word by placing the initial letter at the end of the word
and appending ay. Example: cow becomes owcay and blank becomes lankbay

Rule 2) If a word starts with a vowel, then simply append way to the word. Example: apple becomes appleway and
order becomes orderway.

The letter y should be considered a consonant.

The input format of text is a series of lines from standard input. Each line containing a set of words to be translated.
A line containing five periods (�..) indicates the end of the data. For example:

the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog
because it would not move
�..

If it helps, no word will contain more than 10 characters. No line will contain more than 80 characters. The data will
not contain any punctuation or capital letters.
