Program 95 : An Array of Structs

                 This program is not conceptually hard.

             The purpose of this program is to give you a bit of practice manipulating structs.To accomplish this you need to
                 read the appropriate sections from your book concerning arrays and
    structs.If you have a question,
    then please feel
            free to ask.One skill you are trying to master is the independent reading of technical
            material(the textbook) and
        then applying what you have read.

        A file called textfile95 has an unknown number of NAME and AGE pairs.The maximum amount of pairs that could
        be in the file is 100. Each pair is found on a separate line.For example,

    Shannon 44 Gauss 3 Achimedes 9 Russell 77

    Using an array of structs,
    please read each line of data into your program, sort the data by NAME(ascending order) and print out the name and the associated AGE.At the end of the sorted list, please print out the average age of the entire group of names.For the above example data your answer would be :

    Archimedes 9 Gauss 33 Russell 77 Shannon 44

    The average age is 40.75 years.
