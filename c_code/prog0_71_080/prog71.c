Program 71: Partition Problem

Write a program that prompts the user for a number n. This number represents the number of positive integers that
will follow. Read in the n positive integer values and determine if a partitioning of the numbers exist. Numbers can
be partitioned if they can be divided into two groups, say Group A and Group B and the sum of the numbers in
Group A equals the sum of the numbers in Group B.

For example, the numbers 1, 4, 3, 6, 3, 5 can be partitioned into two groups: 1, 4, 6 and 3, 3, 5.

The numbers 1000, 1 ,1, 1, 1 cannot be partitioned.

Your program should never say that a partition does exist when it does not. Your program should never say that a
partition does not exist when it does. If a partition does exist, then you should output one example partition. Your
program should be able to input up to 100 positive integers.

This is a good problem.

An executable of my solution is called p71 and it is located in ~canning/public/101/problems. Can you make your
correct program run faster than mine? How do you know that your program is correct?
