Program 90 : Recursive Persistence

                 Redo the persistence problem all over again,
             except this time make sure that it is a recursive solution.

             Program 91 : Independence
                          Day(We gave this question on a High School Programming Contest on November 4th, 1994)

                              In 1994,
             July 4th fell on a Monday.Write a program that allows the user to repeated enter in a year from the
                 keyboard until EOF is reaching(control - D) and
                 then the program will output what day of the week July 4th falls on.

                 Example input :

                 1994 1809 1963 2096

                 Expected Output :

    Monday
    Tuesday
    Thursday
    Wednesday

    Note : You should take into account leap years.A leap year is defined as any year such that it is divisible by 4 but
           not by 100 unless divisible by 400. For example,
             2000 is a leap year,
             but 1900 is not .

             You may assume that the year will be in the range 1800 to 2150 inclusive.
